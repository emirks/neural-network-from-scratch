## Neural Network Implementation from Scratch

This was my first AI learning project from my undergraduate days: implementing neural nets from scratch with only NumPy. 

It's quite messy, but I didn't change a line to preserve its legacy as my first steps :)


### Neural Network/
- **`nn-scratch.py`** - The successfully trained implementation
- **`nn-basic.py`** - Basic Sigmoid-based implementation
- **`RelUVersion.py`** - ReLU variant experiment

### pytorch/ (PyTorch Experiments)
- **`pytorchImplementation.py`** - Clean FashionMNIST classifier
- **`ResNettorch.py`** - ResNet50 for CIFAR-10
